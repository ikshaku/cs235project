  <p>I came into my classroom on the first day of school. Everyone was sitting down. The teacher,
Miss Hissa welcomed me and told the class “Today a new student is joining us, his name is
Hamad. Class what do we say to Hamad?”
Everyone: Welcome to our class Hamad.
With heavy steps, I went to my seat.</p>

  <p>The bell rang, class ended, and a boy came up to me. His name is Khalid. He asked: “How are
you Hamad? I didn’t answer. Another boy joined, Faisal, he asked me “Is your house close to
school?” I was very reluctant to answer. I simply nodded with my head to say yes. They asked
more questions, but I answered without speaking a word.</p>

  <p>During recess, I noticed Khalid and Faisal whispering with the others. It seemed they are about
to head some place. I followed them, until we reached the school playground. Each took a spot
and they started to pick their teams. I waited for my turn until I was left alone and they started
to kick the ball and start the game.</p>

  <p>It wasn’t as I expected. Hasan quickly became everyones friend. They all chatted together and
played together. He joined them in the lunchroom, while I stayed alone. “Why” I wondered. “Do
they think I’m boring or shy or can’t be a friend?”.</p>

  <p>In the art room, I painted a large ship that had all my classmates in it. Hasan came up to me
and admired my painting. I was worried I wouldn’t answer him with words if he asked me
anything. I was surprised when he Hasan used sign language to ask me “Why are you not in
the ship with us?”. I replied with sign language “How did you know?”. Hasan said “from the
hearing aid you’re wearing.”</p>

  <p>He explained that he learned sign language since his younger sister also uses a hearing aid. He
encouraged to speak more. I answered “But I thpeek with difficulty” (meaning I speak with
difficulty). Hasan assured me that it was clear enough, and asked that It’ll be ok to speak more
verbally with the others too.</p>

           <p>Hasan asked if I would join him for the class activity tomorrow. We must create teams of three.
Each team is to act out a story for the rest of the class. At first I was nervous to say yes. In the
end I was convinced to push myself and try something I’m not used to. Our team was Hasan,
Jamal, and myself.</p>

After some thinking I went in, I asked Hasan “ Can I thit with you?” (meaning: Can I sit with
you?) He replied “Ofcourse!”. Then I heard another group call me to sit with them. I smiled and
thanked them.</p>
