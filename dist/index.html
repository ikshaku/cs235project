  <p>I came into my classroom on the first day of school. Everyone was sitting down. The teacher,
Miss Hissa welcomed me and told the class “Today a new student is joining us, his name is
Hamad. Class what do we say to Hamad?”
Everyone: Welcome to our class Hamad.
With heavy steps, I went to my seat.</p>

  <p>The bell rang, class ended, and a boy came up to me. His name is Khalid. He asked: “How are
you Hamad? I didn’t answer. Another boy joined, Faisal, he asked me “Is your house close to
school?” I was very reluctant to answer. I simply nodded with my head to say yes. They asked
more questions, but I answered without speaking a word.</p>

  <p>During recess, I noticed Khalid and Faisal whispering with the others. It seemed they are about
to head some place. I followed them, until we reached the school playground. Each took a spot
and they started to pick their teams. I waited for my turn until I was left alone and they started
to kick the ball and start the game.</p>

  <p>In the school lunchroom my class mates sat in groups. I went by all the groups hoping that one
    group would ask me to join them. However I didn’t find any seats around them.
    I sat far away. I eat my food while seeing them all chat and laugh.</p>

  <p>It wasn’t as I expected. Hasan quickly became everyones friend. They all chatted together and
played together. He joined them in the lunchroom, while I stayed alone. “Why” I wondered. “Do
they think I’m boring or shy or can’t be a friend?”.</p>

  <p>In the art room, I painted a large ship that had all my classmates in it. Hasan came up to me
and admired my painting. I was worried I wouldn’t answer him with words if he asked me
anything. I was surprised when he Hasan used sign language to ask me “Why are you not in
the ship with us?”. I replied with sign language “How did you know?”. Hasan said “from the
hearing aid you’re wearing.”</p>

  <p>He explained that he learned sign language since his younger sister also uses a hearing aid. He
encouraged to speak more. I answered “But I thpeek with difficulty” (meaning I speak with
difficulty). Hasan assured me that it was clear enough, and asked that It’ll be ok to speak more
verbally with the others too.</p>

           <p>Hasan asked if I would join him for the class activity tomorrow. We must create teams of three.
Each team is to act out a story for the rest of the class. At first I was nervous to say yes. In the
end I was convinced to push myself and try something I’m not used to. Our team was Hasan,
Jamal, and myself.</p>

  <p>We gathered items to help us tell the story. With my art skills I created our costumes from

    When it was our turn, the class laughed and cheered. They learned about my skills, my love for
    story telling, and my special way of speaking. They love what we did, and the whole class and
    Miss Hessa all clapped for us.</p>
